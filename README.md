# nim-game-VS-Computer

Variant one. In the simple Nim game we developed, the player who takes the last coin loses and the
coins the players took away were simply ignored. In this game, the coins go into a pile for each
player. The player whose pile contains an even number of coins after
the last one is taken wins the game.

â€¢ Variant two. In the simple Nim game we developed, all the coins
where put in one pile. In this variant the money is divided to 3 piles as
in picture. Each player takes 1, 2 or 3 coins from any pile he likes. The player that takes the last coin
loses.
